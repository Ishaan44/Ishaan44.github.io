 I am  a  Master's student ([Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html)) in Mathematics at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. I am interested in probability theory, more specifically discrete probability and percolation theory. I am also interested in the countless connections probability has to other areas particularly group theory and combinatorics.

### Research

- **Percolation of Words** : Ongoing research on the problem of percolation of words (Joint with Ritvik Radhakrishnan). Our progress is documented [here](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Percolation_of_Words.pdf).
   - No exceptional words for percolation on trees: Generalising a theorem of Kesten-Benjamini for periodic trees we proved that all words are seen in a locally finite tree. [[pdf]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Tree_Proof.pdf)
   - Solution to the truncation problem in the non-amenable setting. [[pp 6-7, pdf]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Percolation_of_Words.pdf)
        
-  **Critical Threshold for regular graphs**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00635](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.0063)
  
### Writings
- **Percolation Thresholds under Coverings**: A study of percolation thresholds under coverings. Study of the tecnique of enhancements and other interpolation schemes in percolation. This technique can then be used to show that trees are the unique minimizers of the critical point among quasi-transitive regular graphs. Presentation at TIFR: [[slides]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/VSRP_Presentation.pdf). Article: [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00635).
 
- **Percolation on Hyperbolic Graphs** A study of the proof of the uniqueness conjecture for hyperbolic graphs. My survey of the uniqueness conjecture in the hyperbolic setting following ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10191)) can be found [here](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/ICTS_report.pdf). The slides from my talk at ICTS can be found [here](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/SN_Bhatt_Presentation.pdf).

- **Aizenman-Kesten-Newman proof of uniqueness of infinite cluster**: AKN proof of uniqueness for amenable graphs. [[pdf]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/AKN_Uniqueness.pdf).

- **Supercritical Percolation on Nonamenable Graphs** Seminar on Probability Theory. Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. Fall 2023. My handwritten notes can be found [here](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/SupercriticalNA.pdf).

- **Lectures on the Ising and Potts Model**  A comprehensive study of Hugo Duminil Copin's [notes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00520) on the Ising and Potts model partially guided by Prof. Subhajit Goswami. Click [here](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/3_project/) for solutions to exercises (incomplete)

- **Biautomaticity of Coxeter Groups**: 
  This article was a result of the conference on Geometry in Groups at ICTS, Bangalore. (29th July- 2nd Aug). Notes for Piotr's talk on biautomaticity of Coxeter groups - [[pdf](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Biautomaticity.pdf)]. $$\textbf{*}$$Any mistakes in the notes are mine only!

### Teaching
Every year ISI Bangalore holds the Undergraduate Directed Group Reading Program ([UDGRP](https://mathclubisib.github.io/activities/udgrp/)) during the summers (and sometimes during the winters). During my time there, I participated as a mentor on the following projects:

 -  [Martingale theory and its Applications (Summer 2023)](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/15_project/) 
-   [Field and Galois Theory (Winter 2022)](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/15_project/)


During summer 2022, I participated as student learning [Measure theory and Representation Theory](https://mathclubisib.github.io/activities/udgrp/summer_2022/).
