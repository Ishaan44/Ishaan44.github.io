 I am  a  Master's student ([Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html)) in Mathematics at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. I am interested in probability theory, more specifically discrete probability and percolation theory. I am also interested in the countless connections probability has to other areas particularly group theory and combinatorics.
