Hi! I am Ishaan Bhadoo. I am a graduate student at Trinity College, University of Cambridge studying maths. I am interested in probability theory, more specifically discrete probability and percolation theory. I am also interested in the countless connections probability has to other areas particularly geometric group theory.
