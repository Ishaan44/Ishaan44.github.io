I am a **Gates Cambridge Scholar** beginning my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of **Prof. Wendelin Werner**.  

I recently completed the [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html) as a Master’s student at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/). My research interests are in probability theory, with a focus on percolation, random walks, cover times, and related problems in discrete probability.

### Research

- **Cover Times in Dynamical Percolation** — Ongoing work comparing cover times of simple random walks on static graphs with their counterparts on dynamical percolation.  
  - Established a comparison principle for vertex-transitive graphs and identified conditions under which Matthews’ bound remains tight in the dynamical setting.
  - Builds on techniques from mixing times and hitting times, following the framework of Berestycki–Hermon–Teyssier and related results for the static case.

- **Percolation of Words** — Joint work with Ritvik Radhakrishnan.  
  - Generalised the Kesten–Benjamini theorem for periodic trees, showing that all words appear in a locally finite tree. [[PDF]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Tree_Proof.pdf)  
  - Solved the truncation problem in the non-amenable setting. [[pp. 6–7]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Percolation_of_Words.pdf)  
  - Progress documented [here](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Percolation_of_Words.pdf).

- **Critical Threshold for Regular Graphs** — [[arXiv:2412.00635]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00635)

### Teaching

At ISI Bangalore, I have participated as a mentor in the Undergraduate Directed Group Reading Program ([UDGRP](https://mathclubisib.github.io/activities/udgrp/)):

- **Martingale Theory and its Applications** (Summer 2023) [[Project]](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/10_project/)
- **Field and Galois Theory** (Winter 2022) [[Project]](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/10_project/)

As a student, I also participated in [Measure Theory and Representation Theory](https://mathclubisib.github.io/activities/udgrp/summer_2022/) (Summer 2022).
