Hi! I am Ishaan Bhadoo. Starting this fall I will be a graduate student at Trinity College, University of Cambridge studying maths. I am interested in probability theory, more specifically discrete probability and percolation theory. I am also interested in the countless connections probability has to other areas particularly geometric group theory. 

My CV can be found [here](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf). You can reach out to me via: [ishaanbhadoo@gmail.com](ishaanbhadoo8@gmail.com) or [bmat2119@isibang.ac.in](bmat2119@isibang.ac.in).
