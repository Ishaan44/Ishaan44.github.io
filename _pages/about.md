## Ongoing & recent work
- **Meeting times and Cover Times in Dynamical Percolation**  
  Comparison principles for vertex-transitive graphs; conditions for tightness of Matthews’ bound in the dynamical setting.

- **Percolation of Words** (with Ritvik Radhakrishnan)  
  Generalises Kesten–Benjamini on periodic trees: all words appear in a locally finite tree.
