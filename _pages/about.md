I am a Master’s student (Part III of the [Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html)) in Mathematics at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. My primary research interest is in probability theory.

This fall, I will begin my PhD at Cambridge under the supervision of **Prof. Wendelin Werner**.

You can reach me at [ishaanbhadoo@gmail.com](mailto:ishaanbhadoo@gmail.com) or [ib530@cam.ac.uk](mailto:ib530@cam.ac.uk).

### Research

- **Percolation of Words** — Ongoing work (joint with Ritvik Radhakrishnan) on the problem of percolation of words.  
  - We generalised a result of Kesten–Benjamini for periodic trees, proving that all words appear in a locally finite tree. [[PDF]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Tree_Proof.pdf)  
  - We resolved the truncation problem in the non-amenable setting. [[Details, pp. 6–7]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Percolation_of_Words.pdf)  
  - Progress summary: [[Draft]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/Percolation_of_Words.pdf)

- **Critical Threshold for Regular Graphs** — [[arXiv:2412.00635]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00635)

### Writings

- **Percolation Thresholds under Coverings** — A study of percolation thresholds under graph coverings and the use of enhancement techniques and interpolation schemes. This approach shows that trees uniquely minimise the critical point among quasi-transitive regular graphs.  
  - Presentation at TIFR: [[Slides]](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/VSRP_Presentation.pdf)  
  - Paper: [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00635)

- **Percolation on Hyperbolic Graphs** — A survey following Tom Hutchcroft’s proof of the uniqueness conjecture in the hyperbolic setting [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10191).

### Teaching

At ISI Bangalore, I have participated as a mentor in the Undergraduate Directed Group Reading Program ([UDGRP](https://mathclubisib.github.io/activities/udgrp/)):

- **Martingale Theory and its Applications** (Summer 2023) [[Project]](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/10_project/)
- **Field and Galois Theory** (Winter 2022) [[Project]](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/10_project/)

I also participated as a student in the UDGRP, studying [Measure Theory and Representation Theory](https://mathclubisib.github.io/activities/udgrp/summer_2022/) in Summer 2022.
