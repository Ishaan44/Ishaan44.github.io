### Projects and Research

- **Percolation on Hyperbolic Graphs**
  This project was supported by the S.N. Bhatt Memorial Excellence Fellowship Program at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bangalore. I worked under the guidance of Prof. Riddhipratim Basu and Prof. Anirban Basak. My report could be found [here](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/ICTS_report.pdf). The slides from my talk at ICTS can be 
  found [here](https://ishaan44.github.io/assets/pdf/SN_Bhatt_Presentation.pdf).

- **[Supercritical Percolation on Nonamenable Graphs]()**
  - Seminar on Probability Theory. Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. Fall 2023.

- **[Lectures on the Ising and Potts Model](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/3_project/)**
  - A comprehensive study of Hugo Duminil Copin's [notes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00520) on the Ising and Potts model partially guided by Prof. Subhajit Goswami.

- **[Percolation Thresholds under Coverings](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/4_project/)**
  - Part of VSRP 2024, under the guidance of Prof. Subhajit Goswami. 
   
- **[Percolation of Words](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/5_project/)**
  - Ongoing research on site percolation on non-amenable graphs.  
  
- **Extreme Value Theory**
  - Summer 2022 under Prof. Antar Bandyopadhyay at ISI, Delhi.
  


### Notes and Other Writings

- **[Percolation Theory (MStat 2nd Year)](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/10_project/)**: Notes for Prof. Rahul Roy's course at ISI, Delhi.
- **[Part III Courses](https://ishaan44.github.io/projects/11_project/)**: Notes and additional resources for the Part III courses I took at Cambridge.

- **Biautomaticity of Coxeter Groups**: 
  This article was a result of the conference on Geometry in Groups at ICTS, Bangalore. (29th July- 2nd Aug). This was a very last moment to decision to spend one week at the beautiful ICTS campus doing geometric group theory and probability. Below are the notes for the talks that I attended. My main takeaway from the conference was Coxeter groups and their countless symmetries, for instance Piotr's talk on biautomaticity of coxeter groups was my personal favourite.  I also really enjoyed learning more about boundaries of hyperbolic spaces and the property (T). 

  My notes on biautomaticity of Coxeter groups can be found [here]. $$\textbf{*}$$Any mistakes in the notes are mine only!


- **Percolation theory**: A collection of key mathematical proofs.
