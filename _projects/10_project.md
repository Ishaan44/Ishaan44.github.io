### Martingale Theory and its Applications, Summer 2023
- Mentors: Ishaan Bhadoo, Sarvesh Ravichandran Iyer (Ph.D.) 
- Outline: 
     We will cover basics of stochastic processes. More specifically, we will focus on Martingales and Markov Chains. Towards the end we will see some applications of these concepts in mathematics and finance.

### Field and Galois Theory, Winter 2022
- Mentors: Ishaan Bhadoo, Varun Balasubramaniam
- Abstract: 
  In the nineteenth century, two very young mathematicians, Neils Abel and Evariste Galois, answered a question about which the mathematical world had been curious for centuries. It is a question about the central activity of algebra, solving equations, particularly the question: Is there a formula for solving fifth degree polynomial equations? In this reading project, we will provide a modernized approach towards solving this question and discover the many uses of this approach and how it plays a central role in Algebra.
