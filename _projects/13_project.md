### Uniqueness and non-uniqueness in almost transitive graphs

$$\textbf{Conjecture 6.}$$ Asssume that the almost transitive graph G has positive Cheeger constant. Then $$p_c(G) < p_u(G).$$

A perturbative result: 

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/THM4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>



Grimmett and Newman showed that $$\mathbb{Z} X $$ (some regular tree) then $$0< p_c < p_u < 1$$. We will focus on the following: 

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/image.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
