The study of algebraic topology is broadly divided into two parts homotopy and homology, my course at cambridge deals with homology so here we mainly study algebraic topology 1, i.e., the study of homotopy. We'll follow Pierre Albin's youtube lectures on algebraic topology along with Hatcher's text on the subject. The videos can be found [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpRLWqLFLVTCL15U6N3o35g4uhMSBVA2b&si=SWjl54UVy5MySRuQ)
### Goal of the course
-Chapters 0,1,2 of Hatcher
### References 
Just Hatcher!
