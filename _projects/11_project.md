title: Algebraic Topology (self-study)
description: Preparation for my part III courses on topology
importance: 4
category: Notes and other writings
---
We'll follow Pierre Albin's youtube lectures on algebraic topology along with Hatcher's text on the subject.
### Goal of the course
- Bond percolation on $$\mathbb{Z}^d$$
- Orientable percolation
- Continuum percolation

### References 
For Bond percolation:
- Percolation - Grimmet
- Percolation - Bollobas and Riordan
  
For Orientable percolation:


For Continuum percolation:
- Percolation - Bollobas and Riordan
