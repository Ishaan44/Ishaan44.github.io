This article was a result of the conference on Geometry in Groups at ICTS, Bangalore. (29th July- 2nd Aug). This was a very last moment to decision to spend one week at the beautiful ICTS campus doing geometric group theory and probability. Below are the notes for the talks that I attended. My main takeaway from the conference was Coxeter groups and their countless symmetries, for instance Piotr's talk on biautomaticity of coxeter groups was my personal favourite.  I also really enjoyed learning more about boundaries of hyperbolic spaces and the property (T). 


My notes on biautomaticity of Coxeter groups can be found [here]. $$\textbf{*}$$Any mistakes in the notes are mine only!
