This was a very last moment to decision to spend one week at the beautiful ICTS campus doing geometric group theory and probability. Below are the notes for the talks that I attended. My main takeaway from the conference was Coxeter groups and their countless symmetries, for instance Piotr's talk on biautomaticity of coxeter groups was my personal favourite. I also really enjoyed learning more about boundaries of hyperbolic spaces and the property (T). 


$$\textbf{*}$$Some of the notes might be incomplete and I am in the process of making complete notes for them.
