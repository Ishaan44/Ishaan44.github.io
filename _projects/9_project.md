This was a very last moment to decision to spend one week at the beautiful ICTS campus doing geometric group theory and probability. Below are the notes for some talks that I attended: 

###  Examples of infinite groups, their $$ℓ^2$$-homology and boundaries 
- Lecturer: Genevieve Walsh
- Notes: [Day1], [Day2]...

### Automorphisms of free groups of small rank, and their outer conjugacy classes 
- Lecturers: François Dahmani (UGA, France) & Nicholas Touikan (UNB, Canada)
- Notes: [Day1], [Day2]...

### Property(T), median spaces and CAT(0) cubical complexes 
- Lecturer: Indira Chatterji
- Notes: [Day1], [Day2] ... 

###  Growth of (sub)groups with hyperbolicity
- Lecturer: Inhyeok Choi
- Notes: [Day1], [Day2]

### Coxeter groups are biautomatic
- Lecturer: Piotr Przytycki (McGill, Canada) & Damian Osajda (UCPH, Denmark)
- Notes: [Day1], [Day2]
