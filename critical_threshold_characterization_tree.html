    <h1>Trees have the lowest critical point among d-regular graphs</h1>
    <h2>Ishaan Bhadoo</h2>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this article, we study the critical threshold for an arbitrary quasi-transitive d-regular graph.
    We show that for such graphs G, p<sub>c</sub>(G) = 1/(d-1) if and only if G is a tree. This gives a neat probabilistic characterization 
    for regular trees. We also give counterexamples for the non-quasi-transitive case.</p>
    
    <h3>1 Introduction</h3>
    <p>We consider independent bond percolation on a graph G, i.e., we retain edges with probability p and throw them away with probability 1-p.
    By a simple first moment, a graph with maximal degree Δ &lt; ∞ satisfies p<sub>c</sub>(G) ≥ 1/(Δ-1). For trees of degree Δ, by a dual 
    second moment upper bound, we can get p<sub>c</sub> ≤ 1/(Δ-1), thus implying that p<sub>c</sub> = 1/(Δ-1).</p>

    <p>The question we ask is the following: Consider percolation on a Δ-regular graph G, are trees the only graphs with p<sub>c</sub> = 1/(Δ-1)?
    For the rest of this article, we restrict ourselves to percolation on regular graphs. In light of our question, we show that if one assumes
    quasi-transitivity, then for any Δ-regular graph G which is not a tree, p<sub>c</sub> &gt; 1/(Δ-1).</p>

    <h3>Theorem 1</h3>
    <p>Let G be a quasi-transitive regular graph of degree Δ. Then p<sub>c</sub>(G) ≥ 1/(Δ-1), and equality holds if and only if G is a tree.
    It is important to note that the requirement of being a quasi-transitive graph is essential.</p>
